NFT Gaming Platform

NFT Gaming Platform is a "GameFI+NFT" turn-based strategy game built on the PARKchain. Gamers have full ownership of their in-game NFT assets, such as Nft’s and equipment, all of which can be traded on the marketplace. 
We are committed to creating a PARK social metaverse featuring both "Free to Play" and "Play and ECO". 
In the PARK metaverse, anyone can play the game for free and sell items collected in the game on the marketplace and enjoy a wonderful time with people around the world. 
They can also purchase unique nft’s and equipment, earn rare resources by winning battles or stake mining, and trade their NFTs with adventurers from all over the world to feel the real charm of the Play to Earn.
